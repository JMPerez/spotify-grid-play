# Spotify Grid Play

Grid Play is a sample [Spotify App](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/) showing a tracklist that is rendered as multiple covers.

The default views controls allow rendering a tracklist as a vertical list of tracks, or rendering a cover with a play button that plays the context of the tracklist.

This app shows another option, where each track is rendered using its cover and a play button, and they are synchronized to play in order.
